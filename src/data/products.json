    "shortDescription": "Virgil Abloh's legacy continues with the Air Force 1 Mid. Celebrating 40 years of AF-1, he re-imagined the legendary silhouette through the futurist lens.",
    "fullDescription": "Lightweight, airy mesh with wood grain pattern brings an utilitarian edge, while the spiked outsole connects directly to the ISPA philosophy of Improvise. Scavenge. Protect. Adapt. And as always, Virgil left room for others to be creative—the design pairs traditional laces with a secondary set that loops through Flywire cables. The result: a modernised and experimental reflection on history's most revered shoe."

    "shortDescription": "It's the rare sneaker that satisfies the rule of three—sometimes, having three minds is greater than one. In the case of Jordan Brand, Travis Scott and Hiroshi Fujiwara's Fragment Design, it was a case of three masterminds coming together to collaborate on not just any Air Jordan, but the beloved Air Jordan 1—a model both the Houston rapper and the Japanese designer have tapped for past Jordan Brand link-ups.",
    "fullDescription": "Their Air Jordan 1 Low colourway comes in familiar colour blocking schemes, but with special touches only Scott and Fujiwara could've conjured up. On top of an aged midsole with matching Sail laces, fresh Military Blue accents the heel, collar and insole, providing a new flavour for a classic make-up. And no need for double-takes at the Sail Swoosh—it's indeed backwards—now a signature Scott touch for his Air Jordan 1 designs.But if anyone on the street rubbernecks while you're rocking this collab, they'll know who's responsible: Cactus Jack and Fragment Design logos are embossed on the left and right heels, respectively, leaving their modern marks on this time-tested silhouette."

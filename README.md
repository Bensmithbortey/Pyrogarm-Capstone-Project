<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="https://github.com/Bensmithbortey/MyTreeTutorAppiOS/blob/main/TreeTutorVid.gif" alt="Image" width="500" height="400" class="center">

This project was buit as part of my Brainstation Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp Capstone Project.

Pyrogarm is an e-commerce platform that provides authentic luxury and streetwear items for its customers.

Sneaker Sites have started to lose their credibility in terms of authenticity leaving Hypebeast and Streetwear fanatics looking for other platforms to purchase from. There has been an increase in growth in independent resellers.

EUIPO research estimates that counterfeits such as bags and clothing cost the EU €60 billion, as well as 434,000 job losses. This means that counterfeit goods are now becoming very difficult for people to spot as it may look exactly like the original legit pair with one small detail. For example, the glue used to stick the shoe sole down and size label in the shoe.

My platform will solve the issue of counterfeit goods by giving customers a secure and legit way of buying sneakers that they have always wanted to own. Pyrogarm customers can purchase shoes that have been authenticated by our authentication team. We also have an algorithm that compares photos of legit pairs and compares them to fake pairs. This way we know that the pairs customers purchase will always be legit.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<!-- Available Scripts -->

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
